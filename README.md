# Must-do-Interview-Questions
In this Repository, I have added all the important questions of Data Structures and Algorithms which need to be practiced just before the Interview. These questions have been taken from Geeks for Geeks free course - Must Do Interview Preparation. 
The sole aim is to to gather all the important questions with their codes at one place when a quick revision is needed.
